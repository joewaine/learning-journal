We had a great time learning about everything in practice - our day was a lot more productive than yesterday. It took a lot more time to get used to the CRUD and GPPD cycles. We found that body parser is a lot more important to initializcorrectly than initially thought. after a while the code that doesnt read quite as literally as more simple code before becomes just as easy to read after getting used to it. Ive had a lot of experience debugging today. Looking forward to moving onto project week! I am going to do something straightforward first then add new things layer by layer. Not confirmed any final idea yet but will decide soon.
