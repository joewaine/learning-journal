These last couple of days have been exciting because we have been learning about the building blocks of Postgres. Getting the different parts of our project to talk to eachother with the leverage of middleware. We will learn just how to pragmatically accept data from a json file and perfectly insert it into a sql database by using a variety of utilities. Getting this part securely internalized will help me move forward from where I am now as a developer.
