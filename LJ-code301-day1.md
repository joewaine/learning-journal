Learning Journal, Day 1.

So far I have really enjoyed getting to know everyone I will be spending time with for the next few weeks - everyone has been really helpful and welcoming.

I am getting a great sense of where everyone is at with their skills and realized I have a lot of fundamentals to practice. This is the perfect place for it.

I believe that repetition in some of the setup tasks will help me become stronger in the professional world. I am trying to do things with quicker efficiency. For example, right now I am typing this journal entry with vim!

The mobile first conventions have been cool to work on in a group - Andrew is my partner. 

We did the whiteboarding assignment with a coding challenge that required us to use shorthand to think about our logic before executing the problem. Talking over this problem with Andrew first was fun and a cool way to get to know eachother.
