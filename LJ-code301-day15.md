This last stretch has been a really good period - Ive finally started wrapping my head around Page.js, and enjoying the valuable experience teamwork brings to problem solving. having an extra set of eyes has really allowed me to look at things differently at times. I found that talking out my logic while attempting a problem solve is a great way to keep you focusing on one tiny part of the problem, it keeps your cadence in line and slows you down, it makes work feel more careful.

We got assigned our team, and I am thrilled with the fellows I have been paired up with. I am excited to work with Adrian again and work with Dustin and Rob for the first time! I enjoy their contributions to class discussions and collaboration is sure to be a good time.
