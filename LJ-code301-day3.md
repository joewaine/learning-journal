Its been really great collaborating. The best part of this class for me so far is hearing all of the different perspectives on solving a problem - I really helps me formulate my own deep understanding of concepts i really couldnt explain beforehand.

A lot of things I have known before are making more sense and becoming more relevant to the bigger picture. The class exercises in the browser helped me distinguish the differences and flavors of LET, VAR, and CONST. 

I did some reading into handlebars.js and cant wait to get more comfortable with it. I have used .twig templating in some of my freelance work so its great to see it in in this paradigm. I did a little test where I looped through and changed an object on every iteration to modify the data eventually inserted into the dom. Can't wait for more experiments with this.
