Week Seven has been a bit of a crazy blur, and a massive paradigm shift heading toward the front end.


I am fascinated by the documentation and the potential this library has to redefine the web and how it is interpreted by its architects.

The elegant architecture of React being extremely representational of data an API response yields, or any object for that matter, makes the set up extremely semantic and modular. I really look forward to getting comfortable with these concepts and making beautifully efficient and pleasing apps that other people can understand - from the front AND the back!
