I am looking forward to project week next week. I am barely taking any of this new information in, as Im still stuck trying to get my head around redux, and it's just feeling a bit pointless. I dont see the point of sticking around until midnight every nigth like some people are capable of doing. I like coding, and I like that I can freelance and charge a good rate, but im not really in the place in my life where i need to bleed out of my eyes and feel like my soul is being crushed because I dont understand something. I really enjoy problem solving in groups, and I feel like I will be able to help my team next week during project week in a meaningful way.
