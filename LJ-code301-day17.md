Today for our final project, we got the scaffold figured out for the front end and the back end - I got api keys for the different parts of the google maps api that i will be using (matrix api and places api) - It took some time to juggle the data around, and make sure our team workflow would be organized. Separating tasks seems to be happening naturally. It's been a great experience working together.

I built the api endpoint in server js for dustins front end request to talk to. View line 25 of this file to see the final form of the endpoint:

The most challenging thing about todays work was probably balancing important focus time with group work. There were some interpersonal disputes but nothing major. I just really needed some peace to figure out how to parse some data at one point but after communicating this to my group, we were able to proceed, everyone is very respectful.
