I feel like we have covered so much this week and really entered into a realm that takes things to the next level. Using more complex methods for sorting data and working in a sturdy MVC design pattern are things that will take me a while to get adjusted to, but I see the importance of. We also had a coding challenge that required us to solve the a string reversal in two ways. I think this was helpful because it forced me to think about solving the problem in different ways. I sometimes find that with the code challenges I solve it first in a verbose literal way then go deeper and tighter to make more eloquent solutions come next. I think readability is important when you are working with a team, but when doing coding challenges is it a lot more fun to get as succinct and minimal as possible.
