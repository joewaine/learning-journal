Today was the last day of the project, we really hustled. Last night rob and I stuck around and added some cool new functions for usability sake. I reskinned the projects front end and gave it a more modern look based on some peer feedback. Our presentation went really smooth - A little bit of practice went a long way, and we had some listeners. We even managed to make some people laugh. We got some thought provoking questions from the crowd and our group did a good job of answering the technical and process based questions. I was a little nervous in the final hour before the end of the project but we managed to finish everything.
