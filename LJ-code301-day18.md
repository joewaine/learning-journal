We really tied up some loose ends and got past the finish line with our MVP today. All of the work and collaboration paid off. We had some time to optimize the page and clean things up considerably. A lot of elements such as hard coded API keys are now environment variables. we also got a deployed version of the page up. Dustin purchased a domain.

I added dynamic info windows and styled the map markers to tell more of a story. The blue icon represents where the user currently is, while the red pump icons represent nearby pumps.

The most challenging part today was the group presentation practice exercise. I feel like we really need to practice before tomorrow. I feel like the professionalism of our presentation was unsatisfactory, so I plan to regroup with my partners and be better prepared for this tomorrow.
