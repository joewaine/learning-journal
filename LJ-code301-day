day 5

the first week was really great - it feels good to be doing things with a new perspective. I have had so many questions about why i do certain things for a long time, so it feels good to get a full explanation and approached problems in a more enlightened manner. 

Doing the code challenges has been fun. I start verbose and try and whittle my answer down to one line when possible.

Writing event listeners to target dynamic content is much more maintainable and scalable than just simply using jquery functions without the extended acceptance of elements that are not yet in the dom.
