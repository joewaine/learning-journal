This week has been a lot to take in, I am looking forward to the change of pace the group projects will involved. This weekend my group got some loose ideas of what we were going to use. It was pretty much decided instantly that we would use the google maps api and stick to the classical format of the 301 final project. We figured leveraging car information which seems readily available. Today researched the viability of google maps and what types of apis we would have to use - the google maps places api gives us a lot of information on a place, such as name, address, and the the google maps distance matrix api gives solid information regarding distance and duration between to provided location coordinates. I used a package to npm fetch json to retrieve and manipulate the data. We use it on two counts on the server side. Interpersonally everything has been fine. We are open to communicating. Figuring out what we can do in our timespan has been an important factor to focus in on. I think we will be alright.
