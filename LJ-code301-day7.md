using ajax in a practical applied context in this mornings lab was an important experience in furthering our knowledge on the topic. I enjoyed the lecture yesterday where we went pretty deep with the potential of ajax, but pulling it back for the lab was a good move. I felt like the lab with Matt today took us just far enough to get our feet wet helped drive back the point of yesterdays lecture.
