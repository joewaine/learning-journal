now that we are in the beginning of the third week, i feel the pressure coming on. I am at a new frontier at this point but am having a great time getting acquainted with these new topics. the biggest leap for me in the last day has been the use of an organization structure in github. Adrian and I are chugging along on the group project, it has been really useful to work with allies examples. i like this style of learning because we have been able to move a step beyond editing provided code and moving on to becoming a bit more autonomous but not fully so. its been a nice process for me to slowly move into a more complex realm. adrians working style i solid and thorough, and i look forward to collaborating with him all week.

regarding the codewars kata, i got a bit stuck until i moved back and used some simpler functions instead of the functional programming paradigms. these have been useful to know but i still some more time to get fully comfortable with them.
