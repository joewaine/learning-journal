Today i learned so much and got so much deeper on my understanding of recursion. This is probably my biggest take away for this week. I am still getting used to the new level of work required in this class while trying to not get overwhelmed. My group projects have been really helpful and I look forward to meeting more people in the class. I find it hard to raise my hand in this class but I think if i just go back and do the reading more carefully ill make an improvement.

Looking forward to the coming week and getting more comfortable with testing.
