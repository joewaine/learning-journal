Im in over my head with all of thse concepts at this point. I keep returning to the redux documentation and try and follow along slowly, I think I am getting somewhere but it still seems so complex to me. State, as I see it, it one big object where all of your apps information is being stored in one place, and can be accessed anywhere in the app. If I can fluently write some of these pieces out with heavy practice, maybe this will all pay off. I am unsure and feel the pressure of project week coming up right after this next final week of daunting lessons.
